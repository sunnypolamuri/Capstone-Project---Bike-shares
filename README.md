# Google-Data-Analytics-Capstone-Data-Analysis-Project

This is the final project offered by The Google Data Analytics Certificate. The project done in 2022 consists of picking among 3 projects and choosing which one we should respond and take action. The one I decided to answer the business objectives was the Divvy Bikes project. 

This is an exploratory data analysis project done with Excel and R in Kaggle. The project requires us to do the following: 
- Data Cleaning: Assessing Data Quality, Cleaning Data, Combining and Organizing Data, Creating New Variables
- Data Analysis and Visualization: Divvy Trip Trends analysis and visualization and creating charts and graphs
- Recommendations for Future Analysis
